        <h2>Problem/Challenges  </h2>
        <p>Due to the absence of accompanying imagery, the visual design had to rely primarily on the integration of the company’s primary brand color. Additionally, as the tool was newly introduced, it became essential to establish direct communication with users, effectively conveying the purpose of the tool and its envisioned role in the company’s future.</p>

        <h2>Research </h2>
        <p>I collaborated closely with stakeholders to identify the target audience and define the objectives of the website. Through extensive interviews, I developed user personas and gained insights into their motivations. The majority of users visiting the page are seeking streamlined file maintenance processes and are motivated by the desire to simplify their workflows for improved time management. Leveraging this research, I ensured that the design effectively communicated the tool’s purpose and guided users to explore its functionalities. To create visually compelling elements for the landing page, I conducted research on different visual approaches, drawing inspiration from platforms like Dribble. Ultimately, I opted to utilize an illustration library featuring individuals working with documents or collaborating as a team. By incorporating these visuals, I aimed to convey efficiency and collaboration, presenting the tool as the ideal solution for their file management challenges.</p>
